<h1>TrussJS</h1> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JoeChapman/TrussJS.png)](https://travis-ci.org/JoeChapman/TrussJS)

<p>A JavaScript application framework to promote decoupled event-driven systems and simple composite views. We're still in the development process, but please feel free to play around and give us your feedback.</p>

<h2>Currently on the roadmap</h2>

	<li><del>Mediator</del></li>
	<li>Controller</li>
	<li>Cross-browser Utils</li>
	<li>Support for offline</li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>If you want to play around, fork Truss to your account, and clone the new repo to your machine. When finished, cd into the Truss root directory and run <code>npm install</code> to install all the dependencies, if it gives you the ok, you're ready to start coding.</p>
<p>All our tests are written in Jasmine and run headlessly with PhantomJS from Grunt. To run the tests, so long as you've followed the previous steps, type <code>grunt jasmine</code>, and you should see all green. If you don't, check the issues and raise a new issue if none exists.</p>
